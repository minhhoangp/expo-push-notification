Trading bots are meant to function without human supervision; however, a "work in progress" bot may act aggressively and go on a losing streak. Trading Alert was created to allow traders to closely monitor the performance of their bots at any time. A push notification will be sent to user's mobile device every time the trading bot spots a trading opportunity that waits on user's approval to execute the trade. 


### Built With

* React Native
* Expo
* Nodejs 
* Expo Push notifications tool
* Github (hosts API)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The project requires Node.js and Expo to be installed. 

* Node.js : [https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/getting-started-with-nodejs]

* Expo : [https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/]



### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Run the program using either  
 ```sh
   npm start
   ```
or 
 ```sh
   expo start
   ```

Use your mobile device with Expo application installed to scan the QR code on your compiler's terminal. 

Use `Node server.js` to send dummy push notifications to the mobile device. 

> **_NOTE:_**: user needs to tap on the notification instead of manually opening/switching back to the application from background as Expo's event listener for background activities is only fired from user tapping the notification.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Implement push notifications 
- [x] Show past transactions made by trading bots
- [ ] Send POST request from mobile device to server using Github  
- [ ] UI improvement (eg: fetch new data while backgrounded without notification interection, ..)
