Trading bots are meant to function without human supervision; however, a "work in progress" bot may act aggressively and go on a losing streak. Trading Alert was created to allow traders to closely monitor the performance of their bots at any time. A push notification will be sent to user's mobile device every time the trading bot spots a trading opportunity that waits on user's approval to execute the trade.
